# The living ghost

### Once upon a time, 
### In a small town called _Bruxelles_ 
### Lived a little *ghost* :o

Whose name was Manneken Pis.
Manneken Pis loved scaring little children.
His favourite prank was to pee on them while they went to school.

He went to every house in bruxelles and peed at the front of everyone's house.
Everyone was really very angry by his such act.
They decided to punish him.
