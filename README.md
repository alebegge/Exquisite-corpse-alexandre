# The living ghost

### Once upon a time, 
### In a small town called _Bruxelles_ 
### Lived a little *ghost* :o

Whose name was Manneken Pis.
Manneken Pis loved scaring little children.
His favourite prank was to pee on them while they went to school.


He went to every house in bruxelles and peed at the front of everyone's house.
Everyone was really very angry by his such act.
They decided to punish him.

At the beginning of time, all sorts of ~~great~~ strange things were happening, 
strange things such as the *creation* of people. 
*«If you stopped making them believe everything is sorted out after they’re dead, 
maybe they’d focus sorting things out while being alive and be more efficient»*, 
pointed out Adam to his coworker, Eve. 
*«Or maybe you should stop complaining that humans are acting as humans all the time»*, 
she replied with bitterness.
